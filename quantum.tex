\section{Quantum Computing}
In this chapter we will discuss how to use the  Quantum computer image in \uninuvola. The image contains various quantum computer simulators and the libraries required to run calculations with the SpinQ Triangulum quantum computer remotely. \\ 

\subsection{Python Environments}

\subsubsection{spinqit}
The environment \textit{spinqit} contains all the necessary libraries for running calculations with the \href{https://github.com/SpinQTech/SpinQit}{SpinQit package}. The environment's kernel is Python 3.9.12, as required. The additional pytorch library is included in this library. \\

\subsubsection{ocean}
The environment \textit{ocean} allows the utilisation of the  \href{https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/stable/}{D-Wave Ocean} library package. 

\subsubsection{qiskit}
The environment \textit{qiskit}, from \href{https://www.ibm.com/quantum/qiskit}{IBM} contains the libraries qiskit, qiskit-aer, qiskit\_ibm\_runtime.
